This script will connect to Synergy hosts according to wireless network connections. For example, if the user moves a laptop between home and office, using Synergy at each location, this script will automatically determine the appropriate connection to run and set it up. 

The script hooks into NetworkManager's dispatcher.d service, and as such should be placed in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ on Debian-basd systems.

Future versions will support a variety of network-based actions, such as setting up external monitors and mounting remote shares (e.g. via SMBFS/NFS on a LAN, or SSHFS if remote).
